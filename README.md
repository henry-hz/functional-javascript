functional-javascript
=====================

Overcoming OO adiction through JS, and opening the doors of perceptions for new
languages, as Scala, Elixir, Erlang, Haskell, Lisp and JS frameworks like Redux.
The course will follow the mini-book on functional javascript programming:

### why

1. Modularity - A software is modular to the extend that its parts can be
separated and recombined. -> [Reusable, Testable, Parallelizable].
2. Compositionality - Software is compositional to the extent that the meaning
of the whole is constructed from the meaning of its parts -> [Scalable,
Reasonable]
3. Think about how powerful numbers are, you use them for billions of different
cases, they are a super reusable model. But if you had to multiply 3 chairs vs 3
cars, the power of numbers would be completely limitated.
